Naming Conventions
    Assets
        All assets should follow the following guidelines:
        1. Asset names should start with a prefix indicating the asset type and an underscore, e.g. spr_player
            - Background: bg
            - Font: fnt
            - Object: obj
            - Room: rm
            - Script: scr
            - Sprite: spr
        2. Asset names should be descriptive and short
    Variables
        All variable names should be written in camelcase, e.g. playerJumpHeight

Code
    All code blocks should have comments describing their purpose, e.g. //Set player walk speed

Objects
    Objects used as platforms should be marked as solid.
