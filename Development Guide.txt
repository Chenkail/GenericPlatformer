Naming Conventions
    Assets
        All assets should follow the following guidelines:
        1. Asset names should start with a prefix indicating the asset type and an underscore, e.g. spr_player
            - Background: bg
            - Font: fnt
            - Object: obj
            - Room: rm
            - Script: scr
            - Sprite: spr
        2. Asset names should be descriptive and short
    Variables
        All variable names should be written in camelcase, e.g. playerJumpHeight

Code
    - All code blocks should have comments describing their purpose, e.g. //Set player walk speed
    - Code which extends far beyond the edge of the screen should be broken up with line breaks,
        with tabs inserted to show that the code is a single block

Objects
    Master Object
            - The master object should only be used for defining game constants, and all game constants should be defined in
                the master object's create event code
            - The variables can be broken into groups using comment lines and line breaks
            - In general, global variables which are assigned an explicit numerical value can be modified, whereas variables
                with expressions involving calculations and/or other global variables should not be modified
            - Variables should not be modified should be labeled with a comment reading "//Do not touch!" minus the quotation marks
            - The do not touch flag applies until the next blank line
    Other
        Objects should be organized into folders based on type
        Objects should use parents when possible to avoid duplicate code

Rooms
    Room Setup
        - All rooms should be set to a speed of 60 for consistency of animations and code
        - All rooms should include the master object, which creates all the constants
        - Objects without sprites which are used in the room should be placed together in the top right corner without overlapping
    Instances
        Because GameMaker Studio adds objects to the room in the same order they are placed when designing the room by default,
        the master object should be added first, as it creates all of the constant variables used in the game. If other objects
        were added first, the order can be changed by opening the room's properties and clicking on "Instance Order". The
        instance for the score object should then be moved to the top.
